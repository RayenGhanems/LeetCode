# Explanation:
. We created a dictionary `dicts` that stors and counts the characters of string `s`
. We then iterated thought `t` and if the character is in `dicts` we reduce the value by 1
. if the values reaches 0 we do not subtract anymore since the remaining letters should be replaced by other letters
. and last return the sum of all the `dicts` valuesâ€‹
