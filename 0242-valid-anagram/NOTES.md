# Code Explanation

The `isAnagram` method in the `Solution` class determines if two input strings, `s` and `t`, are anagrams of each other.

1. Create a dictionary to store the count of characters in string `s`. Each character's value represents the number of times it appears in `s`.
2. Iterate through characters in string `s`:
   - If the character is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1.
   - If the character is already in the dictionary, increment its count.
3. Iterate through characters in string `t`:
   - If the character is not in the dictionary, return `False` (indicating the strings are not anagrams).
   - If the character is in the dictionary, decrement its count.
     - If the count becomes zero, remove the character from the dictionary.
4. Return `True` if the dictionary is empty (indicating all letters were used exactly once in both strings), otherwise, return `False`.

In summary, the method uses a character count dictionary for string `s` and adjusts the counts based on characters in string `t`. If the final dictionary is empty, the strings are anagrams; otherwise, they are not.
