# Explenation:
there are two main problems in this question.
# to count the number of rays
  which can be simply found my multiplying the number of banks on the top and on the buttom row (which was easily found by `i.count("1")`)
# to check if there is banks on a certain row and what to do with that
this also can be solved by checking `if rtow != 0:` then so the multiplication and change `rone` to `rtwo` else nothing changes neither `out` nor `rowe ` and `rtwo` will recalibrate to 0 at the biginning of the second iteration.
