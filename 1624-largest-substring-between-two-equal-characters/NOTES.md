# Explenation:
There are two problems to solve in this question :
  1. to know if the letter has appeared before or not.
  2. to count.
# solution
so to solve both of those i created a dictionary that takes each character of the string as Key and the indeciesd of their `first` and only first appearences.
taking only the fisrt retruns the maxinum number for example:
`abaca` should return `bac` so 3 but if i change the â€‹the value of a each time i come acorss it the return value would be 1.
