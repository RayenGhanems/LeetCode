the largest number will be the number with most number of integers in it hence we should start from the last character of the string moving backwards. to know if a number is odd check int(num[iâ€‹]) %2 !=0 or num[i] not in "24680" while i is the last integer of this number. and if it was even then remove this number and try again.
