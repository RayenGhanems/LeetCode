# Code Explanation

The `onesMinusZeros` method in the `Solution` class takes a 2D grid as input and modifies it. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Initialize variables `m` and `n` with the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.
2. Create two arrays, `row_ones` and `col_ones`, to store the count of ones in each row and column.
3. Iterate through the grid, updating `row_ones` and `col_ones` with the count of ones in each row and column.
4. Update the grid elements based on a calculation involving the counts stored in `row_ones` and `col_ones`.
   - For each element at position `(i, j)` in the grid, set its value to `2 * (row_ones[i] + col_ones[j]) - m - n`.
5. Return the modified grid.

In summary, the method calculates the difference between the counts of ones in rows and columns and updates the grid accordingly. The resulting grid reflects a transformation based on the distribution of ones in the original grid.
