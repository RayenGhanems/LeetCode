# Project Title

## Code Explanation

The `Solution` class contains a method called `onesMinusZeros` that takes a 2D grid as input and modifies it based on the count of ones in each row and column.

### Installation

No installation is required for this code snippet.

### Usage

To use the `onesMinusZeros` method:

```python
# Instantiate the Solution class
solution_instance = Solution()

# Provide a 2D grid as input
input_grid = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1]
]

# Call the onesMinusZeros method
result = solution_instance.onesMinusZeros(input_grid)

# 'result' now contains the modified grid
print(result)
