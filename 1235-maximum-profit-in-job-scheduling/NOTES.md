# Explenation

1. I created a n arrya called `array`.
2. I started to iterate through the `startTime` and `endTime` array and searching for if there exists a job that starts after or exactly when another ends. Since if so then the profit if I took this job will be the profit i gained before plus the profit of this job that will start now.
3. and lastly i return the max btween all the combination of jobsâ€‹
