â€‹# Explenation:
I first created an arrya called `array` where all its elements are equal to 1. Then I iterated with `i` and `j` in the nums array with `i` from 1 to `len(nums)` and j from 0 to `i` and we check if `nums[i]` is `>` than `nums[j]` and if so i replace the vlaue of the i'th element in the array `array` to the max btween `array[i]`and`array[j]+1`
this is becuase there might be a better way to rech this point than the time we reached now
